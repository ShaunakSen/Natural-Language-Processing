        "\n",

        "1. __Tokenization__\n",

        "do with language relies on first separating out or tokenizing words from running\n",
        "tokenization text, the task of tokenization. English words are often separated from each other by whitespace, but whitespace is not always sufficient. \"New York\" and \"rock ’n’ roll\" are sometimes treated as large words despite the fact that they contain spaces, while sometimes we’ll need to separate \"I’m\" into the two words I and am. For processing tweets or texts we’ll need to tokenize emoticons like :) or hashtags like #nlproc. Some languages, like Japanese, don’t have spaces between words, so word tokenization becomes more difficult.\n",

        "2. __Lemmitization__:\n",
        "\n",
        "Another part of text normalization is lemmatization, the task of determining\n",
        "that two words have the same root, despite their surface differences. For example, the words sang, sung, and sings are forms of the verb sing. The word sing is the common lemma of these words, and a lemmatizer maps from all of these to sing.\n",

The expression /Buttercup/ matches any string containing the substring Buttercup; grep with that expression would return the line I’m called little Buttercup. The search string can consist of a single character (like /!/) or a sequence of characters (like /urgl/).\n",

        "problem with the use of the square braces [ and ]. The string of characters inside the braces specifies a disjunction of characters to match\n",
        "\n",

        "\n",
        "The square braces can also be used to specify what a single character cannot be,\n",
        "by use of the caret ˆ. If the caret ˆ is the __first symbol after the open square brace__ [, the resulting pattern is negated. For example, the pattern /[ˆa]/ matches any single character (including special characters) except a. \n",

        "woodchucks? We can’t use the square brackets, because while they allow us to say\n",

        "previous character”. That is, it’s a way of specifying how many of something that we want, something that is very important in regular expressions. For example, consider the language of certain sheep, which consists of strings that look like the\n",

Or, you might want to find the word `go` only if it is at the beginning of a word, so that you will find it in `You met another, and pfft you was gone`., but you won’t mistakenly find it in `I forgot my umbrella`. This is the purpose of an anchor; to make sure that you are at a certain boundary before you continue the match. \n",

The pattern `r'ing\\b'` will match `Hiking is fun and Reading, writing, and arithmetic`, but not `Gold ingots are heavy`.
