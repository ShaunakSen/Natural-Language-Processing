    "A high-coverage word embedding table will usually be quite large.\n",

    "it’s completely prohibitive.\n",

    "There are three obvious approaches to reducing the size of the embedding table:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Reduce the number of words in the vocabulary. (obvious drawback; limits the scope of our prediction capabilities)\n",
    "2. Reduce the number of dimensions per vector. (might fail to understand deeper representations of words) eg: it might learn that King represenets some aspect of male but not royalty\n",
    "3. Reduce the number of bits per dimension. (maybe int instead of float)\n",
