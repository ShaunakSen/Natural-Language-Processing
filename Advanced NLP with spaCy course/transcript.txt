They sit across from one another in cracked, burgundy-
leather chairs.

		MORPHEUS
	I imagine, right now, you must be
	feeling a bit like Alice, tumbling
	down the rabbit hole?

		NEO
	You could say that.

		MORPHEUS
	I can see it in your eyes.  You have
	the look of a man who accepts what
	he sees because he is expecting to
	wake up.

A smile, razor-thin, curls the corner of his lips.

		MORPHEUS
	Ironically, this is not far from the
	truth.  But I'm getting ahead of
	myself.  Can you tell me, Neo, why
	are you here?

		NEO
	You're Morpheus, you're a legend.
	Most hackers would die to meet you.

		MORPHEUS
	Yes.  Thank you.  But I think we
	both know there's more to it than
	that.  Do you believe in fate, Neo?

		NEO
	No.

		MORPHEUS
	Why not?

		NEO
	Because I don't like the idea that
	I'm not in control of my life.

		MORPHEUS
	I know exactly what you mean.

Again, that smile that could cut glass.

		MORPHEUS
	Let me tell you why you are here.
	You have come because you know
	something.  What you know you can't
	explain but you feel it.  You've
	felt it your whole life, felt that
	something is wrong with the world.
	You don't know what, but it's there
	like a splinter in your mind,
	driving you mad.  It is this feeling
	that brought you to me.  Do you know
	what I'm talking about?

		NEO
	The Matrix?

		MORPHEUS
	Do you want to know what it is?

Neo swallows hard and nods.

		MORPHEUS
	The Matrix is everywhere, it's all
	around us, here even in this room.
	You can see it out your window or on
	your television.  You feel it when
	you go to work, or go to church or
	pay your taxes.  It is the world
	that has been pulled over your eyes
	to blind you from the truth.

		NEO
	What truth?

		MORPHEUS
	That you are a slave, Neo.  Like
	everyone else, you were born into
	bondage, kept inside a prison that
	you cannot smell, taste, or touch.
	A prison for your mind.

The LEATHER CREAKS as he leans back.

		MORPHEUS
	Unfortunately, no one can be told
	what the Matrix is.  You have to see
	it for yourself.

Morpheus opens his hands.  In the right is a red pill.  In
the left, a blue pill.

		MORPHEUS
	This is your last chance.  After
	this, there is no going back.  You
	take the blue pill and the story
	ends.  You wake in your bed and you
	believe whatever you want to
	believe.

The pills in his open hands are reflected in the glasses.

		MORPHEUS
	You take the red pill and you stay
	in Wonderland and I show you how
	deep the rabbit hole goes.

Neo feels the smooth skin of the capsules, the moisture
growing in his palms.

		MORPHEUS
	Remember that all I am offering is
	the truth.  Nothing more.

Neo opens his mouth and swallows the red pill.  The
Cheshire smile returns.
