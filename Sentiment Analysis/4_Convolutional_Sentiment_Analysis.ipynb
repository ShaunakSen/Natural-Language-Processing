        "Traditionally, CNNs are used to analyse images and are made up of one or more convolutional layers, followed by one or more linear layers. The convolutional layers use filters (also called kernels or receptive fields) which scan across an image and produce a processed version of the image. This processed version of the image can be fed into another convolutional layer or a linear layer. Each filter has a shape, e.g. a 3x3 filter covers a 3 pixel wide and 3 pixel high area of the image, and each element of the filter has a weight associated with it, the 3x3 filter would have 9 weights. In traditional image processing these weights were specified by hand by engineers, however the main advantage of the convolutional layers in neural networks is that these weights are learned via backpropagation.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "The intuitive idea behind learning the weights is that your convolutional layers act like feature extractors, extracting parts of the image that are most important for your CNN's goal, e.g. if using a CNN to detect faces in an image, the CNN may be looking for features such as the existance of a nose, mouth or a pair of eyes in the image.\n",
        "\n",
        "So why use CNNs on text? In the same way that a 3x3 filter can look over a patch of an image, a 1x2 filter can look over a 2 sequential words in a piece of text, i.e. a bi-gram. In the previous tutorial we looked at the FastText model which used bi-grams by explicitly adding them to the end of a text, in this CNN model we will instead use multiple filters of different sizes which will look at the bi-grams (a 1x2 filter), tri-grams (a 1x3 filter) and/or n-grams (a 1xn filter) within the text.\n",
        "\n",
        "The intuition here is that the appearance of certain bi-grams, tri-grams and n-grams within the review will be a good indication of the final sentiment.\n",

A filter that covers two words at a time (i.e. bi-grams) will be [2x5] filter, shown in yellow, and each element of the filter with have a weight associated with it. The output of this filter (shown in red) will be a single real number that is the weighted sum of all elements covered by the filter.\n",

Through backpropagation, the weights of the filters are changed so that whenever certain n-grams that are highly indicative of the sentiment are seen, the output of the filter is a \"high\" value. This \"high\" value then passes through the max pooling layer if it is the maximum value in the output.\n",

        "We implement the convolutional layers with nn.Conv2d. The in_channels argument is the number of \"channels\" in your image going into the convolutional layer. In actual images this is usually 3 (one channel for each of the red, blue and green channels), however when using text we only have a single channel, the text itself. The out_channels is the number of filters and the kernel_size is the size of the filters. Each of our kernel_sizes is going to be [n x emb_dim] where n is the size of the n-grams.\n",
        "\n",
        "#### PyTorch technicalities\n",
        "\n",
        "In PyTorch, RNNs want the input with the batch dimension second, whereas CNNs want the batch dimension first. Thus, the first thing we do to our input is permute it to make it the correct shape. We then pass the sentence through an embedding layer to get our embeddings. The second dimension of the input into a nn.Conv2d layer must be the channel dimension. As text technically does not have a channel dimension, we unsqueeze our tensor to create one. This matches with our in_channels=1 in the initialization of our convolutional layers.\n",
        "\n",
        "We then pass the tensors through the convolutional and pooling layers, using the ReLU activation function after the convolutional layers. Another nice feature of the pooling layers is that they handle sentences of different lengths. The size of the output of the convolutional layer is dependent on the size of the input to it, and different batches contain sentences of different lengths. Without the max pooling layer the input to our linear layer would depend on the size of the input sentence (not what we want). One option to rectify this would be to trim/pad all sentences to the same length, however with the max pooling layer we always know the input to the linear layer will be the total number of filters. Note: there an exception to this if your sentence(s) are shorter than the largest filter used. You will then have to pad your sentences to the length of the largest filter. In the IMDb data there are no reviews only 5 words long so we don't have to worry about that, but you will if you are using your own data.\n",
